# Coffee Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a retail coffee sales dataset to identify key business trends and performance metrics. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I cleaned, modeled, and visualized the data to create an interactive dashboard. The goal was to transform raw transaction records into actionable insights regarding sales performance across different countries, product types, and time periods.

## Problem Statement
A coffee retail business needs a consolidated view of its sales performance to make informed decisions. Currently, sales data is dispersed across multiple spreadsheets (**Orders**, **Customers**, **Products**), making it difficult to:

- Track revenue trends  
- Identify top-paying customers  
- Monitor product popularity  

The objective is to build a **dynamic dashboard** that allows stakeholders to filter and view data by **time**, **product type**, and **customer location** to improve strategic planning.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is a **synthetic dataset** representing coffee sales transactions from **2019 to 2022**. It includes three main tables:

- **Orders**  
  Transactional data including order dates, quantities, and customer links.

- **Customers**  
  Demographic data including location, loyalty card status, and contact information.

- **Products**  
  Product details including coffee type, roast type, size, and unit price.

## Tools Used
### Microsoft Excel
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling duplicates and formatting inconsistencies  
- **Data Modeling:** Using `XLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` to create relationships between tables  
- **Pivot Tables:** Aggregating data for analysis  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Creating slicers and timelines for dynamic user filtering

## Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis:**  
  Visualize sales performance over time (yearly and monthly) to identify seasonal patterns.

- **Geographic Performance:**  
  Compare sales distribution across key markets (United States, United Kingdom, Ireland).
